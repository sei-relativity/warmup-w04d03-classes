# Shops!

Create a class Shop that can help shop owners keep track of their products!

Our class should have multiple functionality:

- initialize your shop with a name and random ID.
---
- **addProduct**
    should take the name, price and stock of your product. Stock should be optional otherwise it counts as 1.


---

- **sale**
    should print out new prices for all your products based on the percentage you pass 
    ```js
    sale(50) #applies a 50% sale
    ```

---
- **stock**
    show the stock of your products
---
- **purchase**
    should take the name and amount of the purchased item. Then subtracts the amount of items you purchase from your stock, if your stock is empty, it gives a warning.
---
- **showProducts**
    Displays all products information!


## Bonuns 

- **removeProduct**
    takes a product name and removes that product from your shop list

----
```js
    shop = new Shop("Supermarket")
    shop.addProduct("Apples", 10, 5)
    shop.addProduct("Bananas", 6, 2)
    shop.addProduct("Apples", 10)
    
    shop.showProducts() 
    # Our Products:

    # Name: Apples, Price: 10, Stock: 6
    # Name: Bananas, Price: 6, Stock: 2
